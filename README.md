# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I deviated from the project instruction slightly for my own version just to change the indentation of the form input and change the color of text so it's not the same as the placeholder text color. I would also like to add another couple forms for a membership program. One to sign-up and another to sign-in.
